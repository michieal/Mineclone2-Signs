Reworked to be an API and to allow players to color, and/or make the lettering for the signs glow (be bright at night).
Reworked by Michieal (FaerRaven), including the sign textures batch changed to be white instead of the original black.

A special thanks to Cora for pointing me in the right direction (as always).


The original Mod, MCL_SIGNS is based on reworked signs mod by PilzAdam:
